Hello everyone, I am Sohit Gore. Though a Software Engineer by profession,
I have never fully experienced the feeling of a full blown Engineer.
I always feel I lack knowledge of some fundamental concepts, and unfamiliar 
with the plethora of stuff existing in the Software Engineering world.

I will be maintaing this site, to share my learnings in the journey of becoming 
an Engineer that I want to be.
For the love of 'Science' in Computer Science and 'Engineering' in Software Engineering
